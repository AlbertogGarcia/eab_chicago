	abstract = {The invasion spread of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is characterized by the formation of satellite populations that expand and coalesce with the continuously invading population front. As of January 2010, satellite infestations have been detected in 13 states and two Canadian provinces. Understanding how newly established satellite populations may affect economic costs can help program managers to justify and design prevention and control strategies. We estimate the economic costs caused by EAB for the 10-yr period from 2010 to 2020 for scenarios of fewer EAB satellite populations than those found from 2005 to 2010 and slower expansion of satellite populations found in 2009. We measure the projected discounted cost of treatment, removal, and replacement of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) growing in managed landscapes in U.S. communities. Estimated costs for the base scenario with the full complement of satellites in 2005e2010 and no program to mitigate spread is \$12.5 billion. Fewer EAB satellites from 2005 to 2010 delay economic costs of \$1.0 to 7.4 billion. Slower expansion of 2009 satellite populations delays economic costs of \$0.1 to 0.7 billion. Satellite populations that are both distant from the core EAB infestation and close to large urban areas caused more economic costs in our simulations than did other satellites. Our estimates of delayed economic costs suggest that spending on activities that prevent establishment of new satellite EAB populations or slow expansion of existing populations can be cost-effective and that continued research on the cost and effectiveness of prevention and control activities is warranted.},

	abstract = {Since its accidental introduction from Asia, emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), has killed millions of ash trees in North America. As it continues to spread, it could functionally extirpate ash with devastating economic and ecological impacts. Little was known about EAB when it was ﬁrst discovered in North America in 2002, but substantial advances in understanding of EAB biology, ecology, and management have occurred since. Ash species indigenous to China are generally resistant to EAB and may eventually provide resistance genes for introgression into North American species. EAB is characterized by stratiﬁed dispersal resulting from natural and human-assisted spread, and substantial effort has been devoted to the development of survey methods. Early eradication efforts were abandoned largely because of the difﬁculty of detecting and delineating infestations. Current management is focused on biological control, insecticide protection of high-value trees, and integrated efforts to slow ash mortality.},

Prior work has shown causal associations between these environmental quality metrics and labor market outcomes, however, never before due to invasive species spread. To address this gap, this paper explores the labor market effects of invasive species-induced deforestation using quasi-random detections of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) as a natural experiment. Using multiple sources of labor market data, it is shown that wage earnings are lower by an average of 1\% in the years after EAB detection. Strongest impacts are observed in the manufacturing (4.3\% decline) and accommodation and food service (4.2\% decline) industries. Additional impacts are observed on the number of Social Security claimants and the number of people employed at firms in EAB counties. Lost labor market earnings due to EAB total \$11.8 billion, or, \$1.2 billion/year over the 10-year period investigated. Many robustness and falsification tests are performed.},

In this paper, we measure the temperature and temperatureinduced health eﬀects of quasi-random tree cover loss caused by an invasive species, the emerald ash borer (EAB). We use monthly temperature data on the near-universe of US counties containing the invasive over 1995–2014 to estimate a temperature dose-response relationship. Then, dose-response results are integrated into a bioeconomic-health model to study the mortality and morbidity consequences of temperature ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd that highest and mean monthly temperatures are increased by 0.28 °F and 0.09 °F, respectively, after EAB detection. There is also a 2.1\% higher probability of experiencing at least one ≥90 °F day per month after EAB. Bioeconomic model results suggest that an invasive-caused 10\% loss of forest canopy leads to increases in mean temperature that result in a maximum of 0.12 per 100,000 additional annual deaths and a maximum of 10.0 per 100,000 additional annual emergency department visits. At peak impact, invasive-induced tree loss creates \$1 million in annual mortality and morbidity temperature-related costs. Cumulative health costs of a 10\% loss of tree canopy are \$17.9 million over 25 years.},

	abstract = {Trees provide many ecosystem services. Widespread tree loss, therefore, would lead to degradations in environmental quality, which might have spillover eﬀects on human health. For the ﬁrst time, the infant health externalities of tree loss caused by an invasive species are investigated. We exploit a quasi-experimental setting where millions of ash trees have been destroyed in the US due to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB). Since EAB spread is quasi-random due to ﬂight and weather, and since ash tree loss due to EAB is extensive, our research design can eliminate many environmental confounders of concern. We use rich, mother-level natality data covering the near-universe of US births over 1999–2015. Diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences results suggest that along the intensive margin, birth weight and gestation are lower by 12.19 g and 0.024 weeks, respectively, after EAB detection in the mother's county of residence. Along the extensive margin, the probability that a mother has a low birth weight baby increases by 0.2\%, equivalent to an increase of 16.2 per 100,000 live annual births. Results are robust to using the synthetic control method and the Lasso method. An internal validity test shows that ﬁndings are not due to the changing composition of mothers after EAB.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species impact environmental quality by disrupting biodiversity, vegetation cover, and displacing native ﬂora and fauna. This can affect human health outcomes. For example, the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) has led to the destruction of millions of ash trees, one of the most common tree species in the US. Since trees are an important source of air pollution sinks, EAB-caused ash dieback may affect human health through changes in air quality. The quasi-random nature of EAB detections and consequent changes in various air pollution levels allow us to analyze differences in mortality rates for individuals living in counties where the beetle has been found relative to individuals in contemporaneously beetle-free counties. Results suggest that EAB are associated with lagged increases in pollutant concentrations ranging from 9.2 to 46.2\%. A 2SLS ﬁxed effects model indicates that EAB-induced air pollution is associated with increases in rates of cardiovascular mortality of 6.2/year–32.6/year per 100,000 people and increases in respiratory mortality of 1.9/year–3.9/year per 100,000. Impacts are greatest for children and young adults. At its peak impact, EAB-induced air pollution resulted in \$4.8–\$21.6 billion in annual mortality costs over 2002–2014 in the 24 US states in the study area.

I estimate that over the last two decades, tree mortality in the American West decreased the value of timber tracts by \$1.1 billion, decreased home values by \$16.5 billion, and increased damages from air pollution, wildﬁre, and ﬂoods by a combined \$921 million.

We use hedonic property price modeling to estimate urban tree cover's value in Dakota and Ramsey Counties, MN, USA, predicting housing value as a function of structural, neighborhood, and environmental variables, including tree cover, using a spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) error model. We measure tree cover as percent tree cover on parcels, and within 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 m. Results show that tree cover within 100 and 250 m is positive and statistically signiﬁcant. A 10\% increase in tree cover within 100 m increases average home sale price by \$1371 (0.48\%) and within 250 m increases sale price by \$836 (0.29\%). In a model including both linear and squared tree cover terms, tree cover within 100 and 250 m increases sale price to 40–60\% tree cover. Beyond this point increased tree cover contributes to lower price. Tree cover beyond 250 m did not contribute signiﬁcantly to sale price. These results suggest signiﬁcant positive effects for neighborhood tree cover, for instance, for the shading and aesthetic quality of tree-lined streets, indicating that tree cover provides positive neighborhood externalities.},

In the ﬁrst stage model, we detected spatial dependence using the Lagrange-Multiplier Robust tests and found signiﬁcant spatial correlations in house prices for each of ﬁve California counties. Our identiﬁcation strategy relies on ﬂexibly controlling for unobserved spatial eﬀects by using the Spatial Lag Model (SAR) to get consistent estimates of urban tree cover. The SAR model solves the problem by establishing the spatial weight matrix to incorporate the neighboring house price. In the second stage, we then used market segmentation to identify the demand parameters by collecting data from ﬁve geographic markets, assuming that residents in each market share common preference structures. Consequently, the ﬁrst-stage analysis provides evidence of positive eﬀect of tree cover on home values, which is robust with diﬀerent speciﬁcations. We further found that the estimated own price elasticity of demand for tree cover within each parcel was −0.075, suggesting an inelastic demand curve.},

	abstract = {In the United States, schools serving urban, low-income students are among the lowestperforming academically. Previous research in relatively well-off populations has linked vegetation in schoolyards and surrounding neighborhoods to better school performance even after controlling for important confounding factors, raising the tantalizing possibility that greening might boost academic achievement. This study extended previous crosssectional research on the “greenness”-academic achievement link to a public school district in which nine out of ten children were eligible for free lunch. In generalized linear mixed models, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based measurements of green cover for 318 Chicago public schools predicted statistically signiﬁcantly better school performance on standardized tests of math, with marginally statistically signiﬁcant results for reading—even after controlling for disadvantage, an index combining poverty and minority status. Pupil/teacher ratio \%bilingual, school size, and \%female could not account for the greenness-performance link. Interactions between greenness and Disadvantage suggest that the greenness-academic achievement link is different for student bodies with different levels of disadvantage. To determine what forms of green cover were most strongly tied to academic achievement, tree cover was examined separately from grass and shrub cover; only tree cover predicted school performance. Further analyses examined the unique contributions of “school tree cover” (tree cover for the schoolyard and a 25 m buffer) and “neighborhood tree cover” (tree cover for the remainder of a school’s attendance catchment area). School greenness predicted math achievement when neighborhood greenness was controlled for, but neighborhood greenness did not signiﬁcantly predict either reading or math achievement when school greenness was taken into account. Future research should assess whether greening schoolyards boost school performance.},
