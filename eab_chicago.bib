	abstract = {Invasive pests cross property boundaries. Property managers may have private incentives to control invasive species despite not having sufﬁcient incentive to fully internalize the external costs of their role in spreading the invasion. Each property manager has a right to future use of his own property, but his property may abut others’ properties enabling spread of an invasive species. The incentives for a foresighted property manager to control invasive species have received little attention. We consider the efforts of a foresighted property manager who has rights to future use of a property and has the ability to engage in repeated, discrete control activities. We ﬁnd that higher rates of dispersal, associated with proximity to neighboring properties, reduce the private incentives for control. Controlling species at one location provides incentives to control at a neighboring location. Control at neighboring locations are strategic complements and coupled with spatial heterogeneity lead to a weakerlink public good problem, in which each property owner is unable to fully appropriate the beneﬁts of his own control activity. Future-use rights and private costs suggest that there is scope for a series of Coase-like exchanges to internalize much of the costs associated with species invasion. Pigouvian taxes on invasive species potentially have qualitatively perverse behavioral effects. A tax with a strong income effect (e.g., failure of effective revenue recycling) can reduce the value of property assets and diminish the incentive to manage insects on one’s own property.},

	abstract = {Scientiﬁc evidence suggests the Earth is undergoing a mass extinction of species, caused by human activity. Evaluating the social costs of losing non-human species is necessary to manage biodiversity and target conservation resources. We show that the functional extinction of vultures in India increased human mortality because of a negative shock to sanitation. Vultures are eﬃcient scavengers and feed only on carrion. In India, a country with over 500 million livestock, these birds provided an important public health service by removing livestock carcasses from the environment. In the mid-1990s, vultures experienced the fastest population collapse of a bird species in recorded history. The cause of death was unknown until 2004 when it was identiﬁed as poisoning from consuming carcasses containing traces of a common painkiller, diclofenac. The expiration of a patent led to a dramatic fall in the price of medical diclofenac, the development of generic variants, and entry into the veterinary market in 1994. We exploit this event to study the costs of losing vultures. Using habitat range maps for aﬀected species, we compare high- to low-vulture suitability districts before and after the veterinary use of diclofenac. We ﬁnd that, on average, all-cause human death rates increased by more than 4\% in vulture-suitable districts after these birds nearly went extinct. We also ﬁnd evidence consistent with an increase in feral dog populations and rabies, and lower water quality in aﬀected regions. These outcomes are consistent with the loss of the scavenging function of the vultures. JEL Codes: I10, Q53, Q56, Q57.},

	abstract = {Urbanization causes the simplification of natural habitats, resulting in animal communities dominated by exotic species with few top predators. In recent years, however, many predators such as hawks, and in the US coyotes and cougars, have become increasingly common in urban environments. Hawks in the
              Accipiter
              genus, especially, are recovering from widespread population declines and are increasingly common in urbanizing landscapes. Our goal was to identify factors that determine the occupancy, colonization and persistence of
              Accipiter
              hawks in a major metropolitan area. Through a novel combination of citizen science and advanced remote sensing, we quantified how urban features facilitate the dynamics and long-term establishment of
              Accipiter
              hawks. Based on data from Project FeederWatch, we quantified 21 years (1996–2016) of changes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of
              Accipiter
              hawks in Chicago, IL, USA. Using a multi-season occupancy model, we estimated Cooper's (

              A. striatus
              ) hawk occupancy dynamics as a function of tree canopy cover, impervious surface cover and prey availability. In the late 1990s, hawks occupied 26\% of sites around Chicago, but after two decades, their occupancy fluctuated close to 67\% of sites and they colonized increasingly urbanized areas. Once established, hawks persisted in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces as long as those areas supported high abundances of prey birds. Urban areas represent increasingly habitable environments for recovering predators, and understanding the precise urban features that drive colonization and persistence is important for wildlife conservation in an urbanizing world.},

	abstract = {Understanding rapid global change requires land cover maps with broad spatial extent, but also ﬁne spatial and temporal resolution. Developing such maps presents a unique challenge, as variability in relationships between spectral characteristics (i.e., predictors) and a response variable is likely to increase with the size of the region across which a model is built and applied. Although most mapping approaches apply the same predictor-response relationships globally across the entire modeling region, learned relationships from one local area may be invalid for another when predicting across broad extents. Here, we adapted a spatial ensemble approach borrowed from species distribution modeling to land cover mapping, and evaluated whether the approach could faithfully represent spatial variation in relationships between land cover and spectral data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) uses an ensemble of regression trees deﬁned within spatially overlapping support sets, producing a broad-extent map that reﬂects variability at the spatial scale of each constituent support set. As test cases for reference maps, we used 30-m-resolution forest canopy and impervious surface cover layers from the 2001 U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) for the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. When testing strategies for support set size and sampling intensity, we found that predictor-response relationships were strongest when individual components of the spatial ensemble were small and when sampling intensity was high. Compared to aspatial bagged decision tree and random forest models, we found that the STEM approach successfully captured variation in our source maps, both globally and at scales smaller than the modeling region. Leveraging the spatial structure of a STEM, we also mapped per-pixel spatial variation in prediction conﬁdence and the importance of different predictor variables. After testing appropriate spatial ensemble and sampling strategies, we extended the predictor-response relationships gleaned from the 2001 source maps into a yearly time series based on temporally-smoothed spectral data from the LandTrendr algorithm. The end products were yearly forest canopy and impervious surface cover time series representing 1990–2012. Formal evaluation showed that our temporally extended maps also closely resembled NLCD maps from 2011. The aim of this research was to cultivate the implicit relationships between spectral data and a given map, not improve them, but as the need for time series maps produced at both broad extents and ﬁne resolutions increases, our results demonstrate that an ensemble of locally deﬁned estimators is potentially more appropriate than conventional ensemble models for land cover mapping across broad extents.},

With a triple-diﬀerence setup that leverages the fact that cicadas only damage tree crops and not agricultural row crops, I show that insecticide use increases with cicada emergence in places with high apple production. Exposed cohorts experience higher infant mortality and adverse health impacts, followed by lower test scores and higher dropout rates.

Trees benefit urban health by reducing pollution; dieback that affects up to 5.8\% of city forests is associated with increases in mean PM2.5 levels that reach 4.4\%. Damage to city forests ultimately leads to excess deaths of up to 1.8\%; much of this increase is driven by increases in cardiovascular and respiratory disease mortality. If the estimated median elasticity of all-cause mortality to tree damage of − 0.42 is extrapolated to all forests in the urban continental United States, my results imply urban forests reduced all-cause mortality by 29.3\%, or 299,000 deaths total, in 2014.},

In this work, I use quasi-random US county detections of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a forest-attacking pest, to investigate how invasive-induced deforestation can impact obesity rates and time spent on physical activity. Results suggest that EAB is associated with 1–4 percentage points (pp) (mean = 37.0\%) annual losses of deciduous forest cover in infested counties. After EAB detection, obesity rates are higher by 2.5pp (mean = 24.7\%) and daily minutes spent on physical activity are lower by 4.9 minutes (mean = 51.7 min), on average. I show that less time spent on outdoor sports and exercise is one possible, but not exclusive, mechanism. Nationwide, EAB is associated with \$3.0 billion in annual obesity-related healthcare costs over 2002–2012, equivalent to approximately 1.2\% of total annual US medical costs related to obesity. Results are supported by many robustness and falsification tests and an alternative IV specification.

	abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with (i) multiple time periods, (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the ‘‘parallel trends assumption" holds potentially only after conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

	abstract = {The invasion spread of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is characterized by the formation of satellite populations that expand and coalesce with the continuously invading population front. As of January 2010, satellite infestations have been detected in 13 states and two Canadian provinces. Understanding how newly established satellite populations may affect economic costs can help program managers to justify and design prevention and control strategies. We estimate the economic costs caused by EAB for the 10-yr period from 2010 to 2020 for scenarios of fewer EAB satellite populations than those found from 2005 to 2010 and slower expansion of satellite populations found in 2009. We measure the projected discounted cost of treatment, removal, and replacement of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) growing in managed landscapes in U.S. communities. Estimated costs for the base scenario with the full complement of satellites in 2005e2010 and no program to mitigate spread is \$12.5 billion. Fewer EAB satellites from 2005 to 2010 delay economic costs of \$1.0 to 7.4 billion. Slower expansion of 2009 satellite populations delays economic costs of \$0.1 to 0.7 billion. Satellite populations that are both distant from the core EAB infestation and close to large urban areas caused more economic costs in our simulations than did other satellites. Our estimates of delayed economic costs suggest that spending on activities that prevent establishment of new satellite EAB populations or slow expansion of existing populations can be cost-effective and that continued research on the cost and effectiveness of prevention and control activities is warranted.},

As it continues to spread, it could functionally extirpate ash with devastating economic and ecological impacts. Little was known about EAB when it was ﬁrst discovered in North America in 2002, but substantial advances in understanding of EAB biology, ecology, and management have occurred since. Ash species indigenous to China are generally resistant to EAB and may eventually provide resistance genes for introgression into North American species. EAB is characterized by stratiﬁed dispersal resulting from natural and human-assisted spread, and substantial effort has been devoted to the development of survey methods. Early eradication efforts were abandoned largely because of the difﬁculty of detecting and delineating infestations. Current management is focused on biological control, insecticide protection of high-value trees, and integrated efforts to slow ash mortality.},

To address this gap, this paper explores the labor market effects of invasive species-induced deforestation using quasi-random detections of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) as a natural experiment. Using multiple sources of labor market data, it is shown that wage earnings are lower by an average of 1\% in the years after EAB detection. Strongest impacts are observed in the manufacturing (4.3\% decline) and accommodation and food service (4.2\% decline) industries. Additional impacts are observed on the number of Social Security claimants and the number of people employed at firms in EAB counties. Lost labor market earnings due to EAB total \$11.8 billion, or, \$1.2 billion/year over the 10-year period investigated. Many robustness and falsification tests are performed.},

In this paper, we measure the temperature and temperatureinduced health eﬀects of quasi-random tree cover loss caused by an invasive species, the emerald ash borer (EAB). We use monthly temperature data on the near-universe of US counties containing the invasive over 1995–2014 to estimate a temperature dose-response relationship. Then, dose-response results are integrated into a bioeconomic-health model to study the mortality and morbidity consequences of temperature ﬂuctuations. We ﬁnd that highest and mean monthly temperatures are increased by 0.28 °F and 0.09 °F, respectively, after EAB detection. There is also a 2.1\% higher probability of experiencing at least one ≥90 °F day per month after EAB. Bioeconomic model results suggest that an invasive-caused 10\% loss of forest canopy leads to increases in mean temperature that result in a maximum of 0.12 per 100,000 additional annual deaths and a maximum of 10.0 per 100,000 additional annual emergency department visits. At peak impact, invasive-induced tree loss creates \$1 million in annual mortality and morbidity temperature-related costs. Cumulative health costs of a 10\% loss of tree canopy are \$17.9 million over 25 years.},

For the ﬁrst time, the infant health externalities of tree loss caused by an invasive species are investigated. We exploit a quasi-experimental setting where millions of ash trees have been destroyed in the US due to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB). Since EAB spread is quasi-random due to ﬂight and weather, and since ash tree loss due to EAB is extensive, our research design can eliminate many environmental confounders of concern. We use rich, mother-level natality data covering the near-universe of US births over 1999–2015. Diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences results suggest that along the intensive margin, birth weight and gestation are lower by 12.19 g and 0.024 weeks, respectively, after EAB detection in the mother's county of residence. Along the extensive margin, the probability that a mother has a low birth weight baby increases by 0.2\%, equivalent to an increase of 16.2 per 100,000 live annual births. Results are robust to using the synthetic control method and the Lasso method. An internal validity test shows that ﬁndings are not due to the changing composition of mothers after EAB.},

For example, the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) has led to the destruction of millions of ash trees, one of the most common tree species in the US. Since trees are an important source of air pollution sinks, EAB-caused ash dieback may affect human health through changes in air quality. The quasi-random nature of EAB detections and consequent changes in various air pollution levels allow us to analyze differences in mortality rates for individuals living in counties where the beetle has been found relative to individuals in contemporaneously beetle-free counties. Results suggest that EAB are associated with lagged increases in pollutant concentrations ranging from 9.2 to 46.2\%. A 2SLS ﬁxed effects model indicates that EAB-induced air pollution is associated with increases in rates of cardiovascular mortality of 6.2/year–32.6/year per 100,000 people and increases in respiratory mortality of 1.9/year–3.9/year per 100,000. Impacts are greatest for children and young adults. At its peak impact, EAB-induced air pollution resulted in \$4.8–\$21.6 billion in annual mortality costs over 2002–2014 in the 24 US states in the study area.

We use hedonic property price modeling to estimate urban tree cover's value in Dakota and Ramsey Counties, MN, USA, predicting housing value as a function of structural, neighborhood, and environmental variables, including tree cover, using a spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) error model. We measure tree cover as percent tree cover on parcels, and within 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 m. Results show that tree cover within 100 and 250 m is positive and statistically signiﬁcant. A 10\% increase in tree cover within 100 m increases average home sale price by \$1371 (0.48\%) and within 250 m increases sale price by \$836 (0.29\%). In a model including both linear and squared tree cover terms, tree cover within 100 and 250 m increases sale price to 40–60\% tree cover. Beyond this point increased tree cover contributes to lower price. Tree cover beyond 250 m did not contribute signiﬁcantly to sale price. These results suggest signiﬁcant positive effects for neighborhood tree cover, for instance, for the shading and aesthetic quality of tree-lined streets, indicating that tree cover provides positive neighborhood externalities.},

In the ﬁrst stage model, we detected spatial dependence using the Lagrange-Multiplier Robust tests and found signiﬁcant spatial correlations in house prices for each of ﬁve California counties. Our identiﬁcation strategy relies on ﬂexibly controlling for unobserved spatial eﬀects by using the Spatial Lag Model (SAR) to get consistent estimates of urban tree cover. The SAR model solves the problem by establishing the spatial weight matrix to incorporate the neighboring house price. In the second stage, we then used market segmentation to identify the demand parameters by collecting data from ﬁve geographic markets, assuming that residents in each market share common preference structures. Consequently, the ﬁrst-stage analysis provides evidence of positive eﬀect of tree cover on home values, which is robust with diﬀerent speciﬁcations. We further found that the estimated own price elasticity of demand for tree cover within each parcel was −0.075, suggesting an inelastic demand curve.},

	abstract = {In the United States, schools serving urban, low-income students are among the lowestperforming academically. Previous research in relatively well-off populations has linked vegetation in schoolyards and surrounding neighborhoods to better school performance even after controlling for important confounding factors, raising the tantalizing possibility that greening might boost academic achievement. This study extended previous crosssectional research on the “greenness”-academic achievement link to a public school district in which nine out of ten children were eligible for free lunch. In generalized linear mixed models, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based measurements of green cover for 318 Chicago public schools predicted statistically signiﬁcantly better school performance on standardized tests of math, with marginally statistically signiﬁcant results for reading—even after controlling for disadvantage, an index combining poverty and minority status. Pupil/teacher ratio \%bilingual, school size, and \%female could not account for the greenness-performance link. Interactions between greenness and Disadvantage suggest that the greenness-academic achievement link is different for student bodies with different levels of disadvantage. To determine what forms of green cover were most strongly tied to academic achievement, tree cover was examined separately from grass and shrub cover; only tree cover predicted school performance. Further analyses examined the unique contributions of “school tree cover” (tree cover for the schoolyard and a 25 m buffer) and “neighborhood tree cover” (tree cover for the remainder of a school’s attendance catchment area). School greenness predicted math achievement when neighborhood greenness was controlled for, but neighborhood greenness did not signiﬁcantly predict either reading or math achievement when school greenness was taken into account. Future research should assess whether greening schoolyards boost school performance.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Green spaces have a range of health benefits, but little is known in relation to cognitive development in children. This study, based on comprehensive characterization of outdoor surrounding greenness (at home, school, and during commuting) and repeated computerized cognitive tests in schoolchildren, found an improvement in cognitive development associated with surrounding greenness, particularly with greenness at schools. This association was partly mediated by reductions in air pollution. Our findings provide policymakers with evidence for feasible and achievable targeted interventions such as improving green spaces at schools to attain improvements in mental capital at population level.
          , 
            Exposure to green space has been associated with better physical and mental health. Although this exposure could also influence cognitive development in children, available epidemiological evidence on such an impact is scarce. This study aimed to assess the association between exposure to green space and measures of cognitive development in primary schoolchildren. This study was based on 2,593 schoolchildren in the second to fourth grades (7–10 y) of 36 primary schools in Barcelona, Spain (2012–2013). Cognitive development was assessed as 12-mo change in developmental trajectory of working memory, superior working memory, and inattentiveness by using four repeated (every 3 mo) computerized cognitive tests for each outcome. We assessed exposure to green space by characterizing outdoor surrounding greenness at home and school and during commuting by using high-resolution (5 m × 5 m) satellite data on greenness (normalized difference vegetation index). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the associations between green spaces and cognitive development. We observed an enhanced 12-mo progress in working memory and superior working memory and a greater 12-mo reduction in inattentiveness associated with greenness within and surrounding school boundaries and with total surrounding greenness index (including greenness surrounding home, commuting route, and school). Adding a traffic-related air pollutant (elemental carbon) to models explained 20–65\% of our estimated associations between school greenness and 12-mo cognitive development. Our study showed a beneficial association between exposure to green space and cognitive development among schoolchildren that was partly mediated by reduction in exposure to air pollution.},

	abstract = {Objective: In the general population, attention is reliably enhanced after exposure to certain physical environments, particularly natural environments. This study examined the impacts of environments on attention in children with ADHD. Method: In this within subjects design, each participant experienced each of three treatments (environments) in single blind controlled trials. Seventeen children 7 to12 years old professionally diagnosed with ADHD experienced each of three environments—a city park and two other well-kept urban settings—via individually guided 20-minute walks. Environments were experienced 1 week apart, with randomized assignment to treatment order. After each walk, concentration was measured using Digit Span Backwards. Results: Children with ADHD concentrated better after the walk in the park than after the downtown walk (p = .0229) or the neighborhood walk (p = .0072). Effect sizes were substantial (Cohen's d =.52 and .77, respectively) and comparable to those reported for recent formulations of methylphenidate. Conclusion: Twenty minutes in a park setting was sufficient to elevate attention performance relative to the same amount of time in other settings. These findings indicate that environments can enhance attention not only in the general population but also in ADHD populations. “Doses of nature” might serve as a safe, inexpensive, widely accessible new tool in the tool kit for managing ADHD symptoms.

	abstract = {A growing body of literature indicates that contact with nature inﬂuence people’s health and psychological well-being both directly and by moderating processes. A questionnaire study was conducted in urban residential settings with high road-trafﬁc noise exposure (LAeq, 24 h = 60–68 dB). Out of 500 residents, 367 lived in dwellings with access to a quiet side (LAeq, 24 h ≤ 45 dB free ﬁeld value; “noise/quiet”-condition) and 133 had no access to a quiet side (“noise/noise”-condition). The present paper examines whether perceived availability to nearby green areas affects various aspects of well-being in these two noise-condition groups. For both those with and without access to a quiet side, the results show that “better” availability to nearby green areas is important for their well-being and daily behavior by reducing long-term noise annoyances and prevalence of stress-related psychosocial symptoms, and by increasing the use of spaces outdoors. In the process of planning health-promoting urban environments, it is essential to provide easy access to nearby green areas that can offer relief from environmental stress and opportunities for rest and relaxation, to strive for lower sound levels from road trafﬁc, as well as to design “noise-free” sections indoors and outdoors.},

By 2009, mortality of green, white, and black ash exceeded 99\%, and ash seed production and regeneration had ceased. This left an orphaned cohort of saplings too small to be infested, the fate of which may depend on the ability of natural enemies to regulate EAB populations at low densities. There was no relationship between patterns of ash mortality and ash density, ash importance, or community composition. Most trees died over a ﬁve-year period, resulting in relatively simultaneous, widespread gap formation. Disturbance resulting from gap formation and accumulation of coarse woody debris caused by ash mortality had cascading impacts on forest communities, including successional trajectories, growth of non-native invasive plants, soil dwelling and herbivorous arthropod communities, and bird foraging behavior, abundance, and community composition. These and other impacts on forest ecosystems are likely to be experienced elsewhere as EAB continues to spread.},

Ecosystem services and values for carbon sequestration, air pollution removal and changes in building energy use were derived using the i-Tree Eco model. In addition, photo interpretation of aerial images was used to determine changes in tree cover between the mid-1990s and 2009. Between the mid-1990s and 2003, tree cover in Syracuse exhibited a decline from 27.5 to 25.9 \%, but subsequently increased to 26.9 \% by 2009. The total tree population exhibited a similar pattern, dropping from 881,000 trees in 1999 to 862,000 in 2001, and then increasing to 1,087,000 trees in 2009. Most of this increase in the urban tree population is due to invasive or pioneer trees species, particularly Rhamnus cathartica, which has more than tripled in population between 2001 and 2009. Insects such as gypsy moth and emerald ash borer pose a substantial risk to altering future urban forest composition. The annual ecosystem services provided by the urban forest in relation to carbon sequestration, air pollution removal and reduction in building energy use are estimated at about \$2.4 million per year. An improved understanding of urban forests and how they are changing can facilitate better management plans to sustain ecosystem services and desired forest structure for future generations.},

In recent years, however, many predators such as hawks, and in the US coyotes and cougars, have become increasingly common in urban environments. Hawks in the
              Accipiter
              genus, especially, are recovering from widespread population declines and are increasingly common in urbanizing landscapes. Our goal was to identify factors that determine the occupancy, colonization and persistence of
              Accipiter
              hawks in a major metropolitan area. Through a novel combination of citizen science and advanced remote sensing, we quantified how urban features facilitate the dynamics and long-term establishment of
              Accipiter
              hawks. Based on data from Project FeederWatch, we quantified 21 years (1996–2016) of changes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of
              Accipiter
              hawks in Chicago, IL, USA. Using a multi-season occupancy model, we estimated Cooper's (

              A. striatus
              ) hawk occupancy dynamics as a function of tree canopy cover, impervious surface cover and prey availability. In the late 1990s, hawks occupied 26\% of sites around Chicago, but after two decades, their occupancy fluctuated close to 67\% of sites and they colonized increasingly urbanized areas. Once established, hawks persisted in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces as long as those areas supported high abundances of prey birds. Urban areas represent increasingly habitable environments for recovering predators, and understanding the precise urban features that drive colonization and persistence is important for wildlife conservation in an urbanizing world.},

As of January 2010, satellite infestations have been detected in 13 states and two Canadian provinces. Understanding how newly established satellite populations may affect economic costs can help program managers to justify and design prevention and control strategies. We estimate the economic costs caused by EAB for the 10-yr period from 2010 to 2020 for scenarios of fewer EAB satellite populations than those found from 2005 to 2010 and slower expansion of satellite populations found in 2009. We measure the projected discounted cost of treatment, removal, and replacement of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) growing in managed landscapes in U.S. communities. Estimated costs for the base scenario with the full complement of satellites in 2005e2010 and no program to mitigate spread is \$12.5 billion. Fewer EAB satellites from 2005 to 2010 delay economic costs of \$1.0 to 7.4 billion. Slower expansion of 2009 satellite populations delays economic costs of \$0.1 to 0.7 billion. Satellite populations that are both distant from the core EAB infestation and close to large urban areas caused more economic costs in our simulations than did other satellites. Our estimates of delayed economic costs suggest that spending on activities that prevent establishment of new satellite EAB populations or slow expansion of existing populations can be cost-effective and that continued research on the cost and effectiveness of prevention and control activities is warranted.},
